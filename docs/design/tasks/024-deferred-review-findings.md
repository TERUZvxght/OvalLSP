# Task 024: Deferred review findings

Findings from independent review that were deliberately **not** fixed in
the change set they were found in, because fixing them would have widened
that change set beyond what its own goal required.

**This is the single place deferred findings are collected.** Do not open
a second file, and do not scatter `TODO` comments through the source for
them — an item that is worth deferring is worth being findable in one
place. Append new entries here; remove an entry only when it is actually
fixed, and say in the fixing commit which entry it closes.

Each entry states the symptom, who it affects, how to reproduce it, and a
proposed direction. Nothing here is a shipping blocker; every item was
triaged as such by the reviewer that raised it.

Status legend: **open** — not started. **fixed** — resolved; entry kept
until the next release, then deleted.

Entries numbered `024.R*` are roadmap items rather than defects: work
that is understood, deliberately not scheduled for the current release,
and too large to fold into one. They live here rather than in a separate
roadmap file for the same reason everything else does — one place.

## 024.1 Duplicate, unused implementation of the controller callback chain

**Status:** open
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/local_inferencer.rb`, `core/lib/ovallsp/server.rb`

`LocalInferencer#infer_ivars_for_action` implements the before_action
chain rule (build the effective callback list, evaluate each callback,
then the action, sharing one step budget). `Server#infer_controller_action_ivars`
implements the same rule again, over its own inheritance-aware method
maps. Only the Server copy runs in production; the LocalInferencer copy
has no caller in `lib/`.

Two same-shaped implementations of one rule means a fix to either can
silently miss the other. This was found the expensive way: a regression
spec written against the LocalInferencer copy pinned nothing about the
path that actually runs, and the production budget-sharing decision was
left untested until round 14 caught it.

`#infer_ivars_for_method`, `#find_static_render_target`, `#find_method_node`
and the `MethodLocator` visitor exist only to serve that unused copy and
its specs.

**Direction:** delete the unused copy and re-anchor its specs onto the
Server path, or make the Server call the LocalInferencer copy so there is
one implementation. Deleting cascades into `MethodLocator`, so it is not a
one-line change.

## 024.2 `Hash.new` / `Set.new` hover as `Hash[Unknown]` / `Set[Unknown]`

**Status:** open
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/local_inferencer.rb` (`resolve_call`'s `.new` ladder)

Consulting RBS before the nominal-constructor fallback means `Hash.new`
resolves through `Hash.new: [K, V]() -> Hash[K, V]` with both parameters
unbound, so hover shows `Hash[Unknown]` where it used to show `Hash`.
Same for `Set.new`. (`Array.new` → `Array[Unknown]` is arguably better,
since it lets the container rules dispatch.)

`Types.normalize_union` already encodes the opposite judgement — it
collapses `Hash[Unknown]` into `Hash` on the grounds that the generic
form constrains nothing extra — so the two behaviours disagree about the
same value. Display-only; no wrong type is produced.

**Direction:** decide once whether `X[Unknown]` or `X` is the canonical
rendering of "container with no known element type", and apply it in both
places. Pin whichever is chosen.

## 024.3 An `untyped` RBS singleton signature still shadows source resolution

**Status:** open
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/local_inferencer.rb` (constant-receiver branch)

The `.new` branch treats a `Types::Unknown` from RBS as "no answer" and
falls through to source/nominal resolution. The sibling branch for every
*other* singleton call returns the signature result even when it is
Unknown, so it never reaches `resolve_class_level_finder` or
`resolve_source_method_member`.

Reproduce: declare `def self.build: (...) -> untyped` in a project `sig/`
or Sorbet RBI for a class that also defines `self.build` in source; a
call resolves to Unknown instead of the source return type. Requires a
project-supplied untyped signature, so it does not occur with stdlib
alone.

**Direction:** apply the same Unknown filter to the non-`new` branch.

## 024.4 `BeforeActionFinder#record` mutates the Prism AST in place

**Status:** open
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/local_inferencer.rb`

`arguments.pop` operates on the array Prism owns, not a copy (verified:
the node's own `arguments.arguments` shrinks). Harmless today because the
document is re-parsed on every call and each statement is visited once;
it becomes a live bug as soon as anything caches or re-walks that tree.

**Direction:** `arguments[0...-1]` instead of `pop`.

## 024.5 `Server#index_references` is dead

**Status:** open
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/server.rb`

Both former callers now go through `apply_file_summary` plus
`mark_reference_index_dirty`. The risk is a future change to reference
resolution being made in the dead copy.

**Direction:** delete.

## 024.6 The `seen_uris` spec's comment overclaims

**Status:** open
**Area:** `core/spec/ovallsp/cold_indexer_spec.rb`

The comment says the spec covers a file already open in a buffer, but no
`DocumentStore` entry is created, so that branch is never exercised.
`@seen_uris << uri` sits above the open-buffer early return and nothing
pins that ordering. No live consequence: the deletion sweep verifies
absence with `File.file?` rather than trusting `seen_uris`.

**Direction:** add the buffer case, or trim the comment to what the spec
actually asserts.

## 024.7 `rootIdentity`'s refresh assignment cannot affect any decision

**Status:** open
**Area:** `vscode/src/coreProcess.ts`

`this.rootIdentity = rootRow` in the "still our process" branch is
documented as picking up a post-setsid pgid change, but the only
comparison it feeds (`sameRootProcess`) looks at `pid` and `startedAt`,
both invariant over the process's life. The pgid tolerance the comment
credits it with actually comes from `sameRootProcess` not comparing pgid
at all. The line is unpinnable by construction — no fixture can
distinguish it.

**Direction:** delete the line, or correct the comment to say it is
insurance against `sameRootProcess` tightening later.

## 024.8 Ownership retirement on `exited() && known.size === 0` is unpinned

**Status:** open
**Area:** `vscode/src/coreProcess.ts`

Clearing `ownedSessionId`/`ownedGroupId` there is defence-in-depth: the
expansion gate already prevents the failure it guards against, and no
concrete failing scenario could be constructed for its removal. Recorded
because unpinned behavioural lines count as defects in this project.

**Direction:** a test, not a code change — or delete the lines if the
invariant is genuinely carried elsewhere.

## 024.9 A forced crash popup can still appear for deliberate stops

**Status:** open
**Area:** `vscode/src/extension.ts` (`OvalLspLanguageClient.error`)

The suppression keys off the branded rejection arriving as `data`. That
covers the two paths that carry it, but not vscode-languageclient's
`DoNotRestart` notice, which passes `data === undefined` with `'force'`.

Reproduce: stop the client five times within three minutes while it is
still `starting` (repeated *OvalLSP: Restart Server* during the
compatibility probe). `stopClient` deliberately does not call
`client.stop()` in that state — it terminates Core directly — so the
library sees five connection closures and reports *"The OvalLSP server
crashed 5 times in the last 3 minutes"*, about five deliberate stops.

**Direction:** key the suppression on lifecycle state or the message,
rather than on `data` alone.

## 024.10 Four `extension.ts` behaviours cannot be unit-tested

**Status:** open
**Area:** `vscode/src/extension.ts`

`extension.ts` imports `vscode`, which the unit suite cannot load, so
these four are covered only by manual verification: awaiting
`client.stop()` rather than firing it off, `stopClient` draining
retirements for an untracked generation, the shutdown-barrier check when
a workspace folder is added, and the restart notification wording.

**Direction:** extract the testable logic out of the `vscode`-importing
module, or add an integration test host.

## 024.11 Core reports version 0.0.1 while the extension reports 0.1.5

**Status:** fixed — `Ovallsp::VERSION` now tracks the extension version,
and `copy-core.js` refuses to build a bundled payload where the two
disagree. The rule and its exemptions are in `docs/PUBLISHING.md`.
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/version.rb`, surfaced by `OvalLSP: Show Version Information`

`Ovallsp::VERSION` has been `0.0.1` since the rebrand, so `initialize`
answers `serverInfo.version` / `ovallspInfo.coreVersion` as `0.0.1` while
the extension reports its own `0.1.5`. Compatibility is judged on the
protocol range, not on these strings, so nothing misbehaves — but the
version panel shows a pairing that looks wrong to anyone reading it, and
a bug report quoting "Core 0.0.1" is hard to map to a release.

**Direction:** decide whether the gem version tracks the extension
version or is deliberately independent, and either bump it in step or say
so in the version panel's own wording.

## 024.R1 Rails-specific behaviour has no explicit boundary (roadmap, 1.0.0)

**Status:** open — roadmap
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/server.rb`, `core/lib/ovallsp/parser_service.rb`,
`core/lib/ovallsp/local_inferencer.rb`

Rails detection gates exactly one thing: whether `RailsBootstrap.start`
spawns the Runtime Agent (`bin/rails` + `config/environment.rb` must both
exist). Everything downstream is not branched on "is this Rails" at all —
the same code runs either way, and in a plain Ruby project the
Rails-derived registries are simply empty, so those features contribute
nothing.

That part is a good property: a wrong Rails guess degrades to static
analysis instead of breaking, and it is the same path an untrusted
workspace takes when the Agent deliberately does not start.

The gap is that several Rails *conventions* are applied on filename and
method-name shape alone, with no Rails gate anywhere:

- controller-to-view ivar propagation matches
  `app/views/<dir>/<action>.*.erb`
- file-change classification matches `app/models/*.rb`, `db/schema.rb`,
  `db/structure.sql`, `db/migrate/`
- `before_action` is recognised by method name
- `enum`/`scope`/`delegate` generated-method facts are recorded by method
  name

So a plain Ruby project that happens to use those names or that directory
layout gets Rails semantics applied to it. No incorrect behaviour has
been observed — the registries those paths feed are empty without an
Agent — but the boundary is implicit, and nothing tests what a non-Rails
project experiences.

**Direction:** give the Rails conventions one explicit boundary (a
capability/profile decided once at initialize, from the same detection
that gates the Agent) rather than re-deriving "this looks like Rails"
from a path pattern at each site. Add a plain-Ruby workspace to the E2E
capability suite so the non-Rails experience is specified and verified
rather than assumed.

Deferred out of 0.1.6 deliberately: it is an architectural change across
three files, and 0.1.6's goal is that the capabilities already claimed to
work actually do.

One of the two things 1.0.0 requires (`docs/PUBLISHING.md`, "0.x, and
what 1.0.0 requires"): a plain Ruby project must be guaranteed, not only
a Rails one. Until then README's capability matrix carries ⚠️ for that
column and this entry is why.

## 024.R2 Argument *type* checking (roadmap, 0.2.0)

**Status:** open — roadmap
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/diagnostics/engine.rb`

0.1.6 added an argument *count* check (capability G5). Nothing inspects
what the arguments actually are: passing a String where the parameter is
only ever used as an Integer is not reported.

Doing it honestly needs more than the count check did. Parameter types
are not declared in Ruby source, so the expected type has to come from
RBS/RBI where one exists, or from inference over the method body where it
does not — and a wrong "expected Integer, got String" on code that runs
is worse than saying nothing, the same standard G5 was held to.

**Direction:** start where the expected type is stated rather than
inferred (RBS/RBI-declared parameters, and the built-in container rules),
and report only when the argument's own inferred type is a concrete
Nominal that cannot match. Leave everything else silent.

Referenced from README's capability matrix as the version this is planned
for, so the table's promise and this entry stay in step.

---

## 024.R3 Feature parity roadmap, measured against Pylance

**Status:** open — roadmap

Pylance is the closest well-known reference point for "what a language
server is expected to do" in a dynamically typed language with optional
type declarations, so it is a useful yardstick — not a target to copy.
Rows Pylance has that make no sense here (Jupyter support, IntelliCode's
ranked completions, Python-specific stub packaging) are deliberately
absent rather than listed and dismissed.

Current OvalLSP capabilities were read from the `initialize` response and
the code, not assumed: `hoverProvider`, `documentSymbolProvider`,
`definitionProvider`, `referencesProvider`, `renameProvider`,
`workspaceSymbolProvider`, `completionProvider`, `signatureHelpProvider`.
Everything else below is absent.

| Pylance capability | OvalLSP today | Planned for | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Diagnostics across the whole project | Open files only | **0.2.0** | The first thing a user noticed as missing. `publishDiagnostics` fires from `reindex`, which only runs for open buffers, so a mistake in a file you are not looking at is invisible. Needs a workspace-wide pass plus a budget, or LSP pull diagnostics. |
| Docstrings in hover and completion | Type, origin and definition location only | **0.2.0** | Ruby has RDoc/YARD comments directly above a `def`. Nothing reads them. Hover shows what a thing *is* but never what it is *for*, which is most of hover's value. |
| Semantic highlighting (semantic tokens) | None | **0.2.0** | Unusually valuable in Ruby, where `foo` alone is ambiguous between a local variable and a method call on self — the engine already knows which, and the editor currently does not. Covers ERB templates' Ruby regions too, which the shared extraction path now makes free. Distinct from shipping a TextMate grammar, which is a non-goal: VS Code already associates `.erb`, and another grammar would only collide. |
| Inlay hints (inferred types, parameter names) | None | **0.3.0** | The type engine's answers are only visible on hover today. Inlay hints put them where the code is, which is the difference between a feature people use and one they remember exists. |
| Code actions / quick fixes | None | **0.3.0** | Each existing diagnostic implies one: define the missing method, correct the route helper name, fix the argument count. A diagnostic that only complains is half a feature. |
| Go to type definition | Go to definition only | **0.3.0** | Cheap given `explainType` already resolves the type: jump from an expression to the class it evaluates to, rather than to the method being called. |
| Document highlight (occurrences in file) | None | **0.3.0** | Small and self-contained: the reference index already answers this workspace-wide, so scoping it to one file is nearly free. |
| Call hierarchy | Find references only | **0.3.0** | An incremental step on the same index. Callers/callees of a method, navigable, rather than a flat list. |
| Auto-import / add `require` | None | **0.4.0** | Much weaker payoff than in Python: Rails autoloads, and plain Ruby projects mostly `require` at the entry point. Worth revisiting only after the plain-Ruby story (024.R1) exists. |
| Type checking strictness levels | One fixed set of checks | **0.4.0** (as per-check severity) | Pylance's basic/strict switch matters because its checks are numerous and opinionated. With four checks, a per-check severity setting would cover the same need more simply. |
| Signature help with active parameter tracking | Signature label only | **0.4.0** | Already useful; highlighting which argument the cursor is in is a refinement, not a gap. |
| Generating type stubs from source | RBS/RBI are read, never written | not planned | Interesting for library authors, irrelevant to the Rails application developer this Preview targets. |

Not planned, and listed only so their absence is a decision rather than
an oversight: unreachable-code dimming (RuboCop covers the same ground
for Ruby users), refactoring extractions beyond rename, and anything
notebook-shaped.

Ordered by what a user notices soonest rather than by effort:
whole-project diagnostics, then documentation in hover/completion, then
semantic tokens, then inlay hints and code actions. The first two are
noticed in the first ten minutes.

These versions are also carried in README.md and README.ja.md's
capability matrix, which is the user-facing statement of them; this
section is the reasoning behind each. Keep the two in step.

## 024.R4 Only one platform is published or verified (roadmap, 1.0.0)

**Status:** open — roadmap
**Area:** `vscode/package.json` (`--target darwin-arm64`),
`.github/workflows/apple-silicon-release.yml`, `vscode/scripts/copy-core.js`

One VSIX is published, for `darwin-arm64`, and it is the only environment
any capability has been verified in. On every other platform the
situation is not "probably fine" but "unpublished": VS Code filters
Marketplace results by target, so there is nothing to install on Windows,
Linux, or an Intel Mac.

The obstacle is the vendored payload rather than the code. `prism` and
`rbs` ship as native extensions built for the packaging machine's Ruby
ABI, OS and CPU, so a VSIX is only valid for the combination
`PLATFORM_MANIFEST.json` records. Sideloading the darwin-arm64 build
elsewhere does not crash — `Ovallsp::VendorCompatibility` and
`platformCompatibility.ts` refuse the payload and explain why (ADR-0005)
— but it then depends on the user's own Ruby having prism/rbs, which is
unverified.

`.github/workflows/apple-silicon-release.yml` deliberately asserts an
arm64 interpreter before building, so it cannot be pointed at another
target as-is.

**Direction:** a per-target build matrix producing one VSIX per platform,
each built on that platform (never cross-compiled or emulated, for the
reason above), each running the capability suite against its own bundled
Core, and each published. `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`'s tiers then become
statements about verified artifacts rather than about one artifact and
several unknowns.

The other of the two things 1.0.0 requires (`docs/PUBLISHING.md`, "0.x,
and what 1.0.0 requires").

---

## 024.R5 A reopened gem class still looks closed (done, 0.1.7)

**Status:** done — shipped in 0.1.7. Measured against the same real
application that reported it: 2 diagnostics before, 0 after.
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/diagnostics/engine.rb`,
`core/lib/ovallsp/runtime_agent/agent.rb`

0.1.6 stopped the unknown-method check firing on classes whose ancestry
the workspace cannot see: a chain that does not reach BasicObject is
treated as open, which covers a gem superclass named by constant and a
superclass that is an expression (`ActiveRecord::Migration[8.1]`).

One case is left, and it is not a gap in the rule but a limit of static
analysis. Reopening a class the workspace does not define looks identical
to defining it:

```ruby
module ActiveSupport
  class TestCase          # a reopen: the real class lives in a gem
    parallelize(workers: :number_of_processors)
  end
end
```

Ruby keeps the original superclass when a class is reopened, but nothing
in this file says so, so the declaration reads as a plain class with no
parent — Object, Kernel, BasicObject, complete. `parallelize` and
`fixtures` are then reported as undefined. Every Rails application's
`test/test_helper.rb` has exactly this shape, so this is the common case,
not an exotic one.

Distinguishing the two needs to know where the constant was really
defined, which only the running application knows.

**Direction (superseded — kept because the disproof is the useful part):**
ask the Runtime Agent for `Object.const_source_location`, and treat a
constant defined outside the workspace root as one whose real method set
is unknown here.

**`const_source_location` cannot answer this.** Measured against the same
application, in the environment the Agent actually boots:

| Constant | `const_source_location` |
|---|---|
| `ActiveSupport::TestCase` | `activesupport-8.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies/autoload.rb:41` |
| `ActiveRecord::Base` | the same `autoload.rb:41` |
| `ApplicationController` | `zeitwerk-2.8.2/lib/zeitwerk/cref.rb:47` |
| `ApplicationRecord` | the same `cref.rb:47` |
| `Ovaldev::Application` | `config/application.rb:10` |
| `String` | `[]` |

It reports where the constant was *registered*, not where the class was
written. Every `ActiveSupport::Autoload` constant points at one line of
`autoload.rb`, and every Zeitwerk-managed constant — which is every class
in `app/` — points at one line of `cref.rb`. So the rule "defined outside
the workspace root means not ours" would classify `ApplicationController`
and `ApplicationRecord`, the application's own classes, as foreign. That
is the same bug pointed the other way, and worse: it would silence the
check across all of `app/` instead of misfiring twice in one file.

Two further approaches were measured and rejected:

- **Walk every constant and record its origin** (the cheap precursor to
  024.R7). `Module#const_get` on an autoload-registered constant *runs
  the autoload*: the walk raised `Gem::LoadError: listen is not part of
  the bundle` in `active_support/evented_file_update_checker` before
  finishing. Enumerating constants is not a read-only operation, and an
  Agent that loads arbitrary code to answer a diagnostic question is not
  one worth having.
- **Report the runtime's method set for the class**, the way model
  methods already are. It fixes `parallelize` and not `fixtures`: the
  Agent boots `config/environment.rb`, not `rails/test_help`, so
  `ActiveSupport::TestCase.respond_to?(:fixtures)` is genuinely `false`
  in the process being asked. Runtime truth is the wrong instrument when
  the truth differs per environment, and the file in question is the one
  file that only ever loads in a different one.

**Direction (measured, and what 0.1.7 implements):** ask the Agent for
the class's **ancestors**, and compare them against `Object.ancestors`
taken in the same process. The static claim being tested is precisely
"this class's ancestry is complete", so test it against the ancestry:

```
PlainWorkspaceThing      8 ancestors,  0 beyond Object's
ActiveSupport::TestCase 28 ancestors, 20 beyond Object's
```

Using the running process's own `Object.ancestors` as the baseline is
what makes this robust: an application that mixes into `Object` (this one
mixes in four modules, from Active Support and JSON) calibrates the
baseline itself, so no list of "expected" ancestors has to be maintained
or guessed. A class carrying ancestors beyond it that the workspace does
not declare and RBS does not know is one the workspace did not write
alone — so the chain the static index believes is complete is not, and
the check stays silent for that receiver.

The question is asked of **every workspace-declared link in the chain**,
not just the receiver. Reopening `ActiveSupport::TestCase` makes that name
workspace-declared, so every `class FooTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase`
then has a static chain that reaches BasicObject *through* it — while the
subclass itself is a genuine workspace class the Agent rightly cannot
place. Asking only about the receiver left every test file in the project
reporting the gem's whole API as unknown: the same false positive, one
level down. The implicit `Object`/`Kernel`/`BasicObject` tail is skipped,
since those are not links the workspace wrote.

Cache per class; ancestors cannot change without a restart. Ask lazily,
for the names the check is actually about to report on, rather than
enumerating anything — that is a handful of names per session, and it
avoids both the load-everything hazard above and any dependency on the
index being built before the Agent answers.

Modules need no special case: a module's static chain never reaches
BasicObject, so `chain_reaches_root?` already treats every module as
open. Confirmed against the same fixture — `module ActiveSupport` indexes
as the single ancestor `::ActiveSupport`, and nothing is reported for it.

A second, currently latent instance of the same mistake is answerable
from the Agent too, though not by the same request.
`unresolved-constant` reports any constant that is neither in
the workspace nor in RBS, which in a Rails application means every gem
constant: measured against `config/application.rb`, it reports `Rails`
and `Bundler` as unresolvable. It does not reach users today because the
check only runs in `standard` mode and the extension never sends
`diagnosticsMode`, so `safe` is the only mode reachable -- but the check
is unusable as written, and enabling it without this would repeat the
false-positive flood the unknown-method check just came out of.
`Object.const_defined?` from the Agent settles it exactly.

**What shipped**, and the one part the measurement above did not predict:
the ancestor comparison alone does not fix the reported case.
`ActiveSupport::TestCase` is not loaded in the environment the Agent
boots — `config/environment.rb`, not `rails/test_help` — so there are no
ancestors to compare, and the first working version of this still
reported both calls. The autoload registration is what settles it:
Zeitwerk registers the application's own classes by absolute path under
the workspace root, while a gem's `autoload` registers the bare require
path it was written with (`"active_support/test_case"`). So the Agent
answers one of three things per name — the real ancestors, "registered
from outside this workspace", or nothing — and the third leaves the
static reading standing, which is the right answer for a class the
workspace genuinely owns but has not loaded.

**What it still misses**, found by independent review rather than by the
change set's own tests, and worth stating precisely because the ancestor
comparison is the part this entry leads with: a reopened gem class whose
ancestry carries nothing foreign is invisible to it. `class String; def
to_bool; end; end` in an initializer gives `[String, Comparable, Object,
Kernel, BasicObject]` — `Comparable` is RBS-known, so no ancestor
disqualifies it, and a call to an Active Support core extension defined
directly on `String` is still reported. The same holds for any gem class
reopened without mixins (`class Faraday::Connection`). The reported
`ActiveSupport::TestCase` case is fixed by the autoload branch, not by
the ancestor comparison — the comparison covers the loaded-and-mixed
case, which is a different one.

Four further cases the Agent cannot settle, all reported by independent
review and all leaving the check firing where it should be silent:

- **The Agent's process is not the test environment.** It boots
  `config/environment.rb` with no `RAILS_ENV` set, so `development`. A gem
  in `group :test`, or one with `require: false`, is neither loaded nor
  autoload-registered there, so its classes answer `:absent` and the
  static reading stands.
- **A top-level name the workspace and a gem both use.** `resolve_owner`
  starts every walk at `::Object` with no notion of the workspace, so a
  workspace PORO called `Configuration` or `Response` resolves in the
  Agent to whichever gem owns that constant, and *that* class's foreign
  ancestors silence the check for the workspace's own.
- **Engines and monorepos.** `workspace_path?` compares against
  `Rails.root`, so a class autoloaded from `/repo/engines/billing` while
  `Rails.root` is `/repo/backend` reads as defined outside the workspace.
- **Singleton-only provenance.** The Agent reports `Module#ancestors`,
  the instance chain, so a class whose gem origin shows only in its
  singleton class is invisible to the ancestor comparison. Mostly moot in
  practice: a statically visible `extend` already puts the module in the
  singleton chain, where `ancestor_known?` opens the receiver anyway.

A crash-looped Agent is not on this list, and deliberately: once
`AgentSupervisor` gives up, `AncestryRegistry#deactivate!` puts the check
back on the static reading, exactly as if no Agent had ever existed.
Without that the check would defer forever to an answer that cannot come,
which is not degrading gracefully — it is going silent.

Closing all of these needs to know where each *method* came from, not
where the class did, which is 024.R7's territory.

The check remains silent for gem-derived classes reached by superclass
(024.R7 is what lifts that), and behaves exactly as it did in 0.1.6
wherever there is no Runtime Agent to ask.

## 024.R6 Reading an instance variable that is never assigned (roadmap, 0.2.0)

**Status:** open — roadmap
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/diagnostics/engine.rb`

Nothing reports `@usr` where the code meant `@user`. Ruby returns `nil`
for an unassigned instance variable rather than raising, so this is a
mistake the language itself never surfaces: the view renders empty and
nobody is told why.

The information is already here. Controller-to-view propagation infers
the set of instance variables an action assigns, including through the
`before_action` chain (capability H3). A read of an `@ivar` that no
assignment in the effective chain produces is reportable with high
confidence.

**Direction:** report an `@ivar` read when the enclosing method, its
callback chain, and its ancestors contain no assignment to it. Stay
silent where assignments could come from somewhere unmodelled --
`instance_variable_set`, a concern the workspace cannot see -- on the
same standard as every other check here.

## 024.R7 Index what the gems actually define, and keep it fresh (roadmap, 0.3.0)

**Status:** open — roadmap
**Area:** `core/lib/ovallsp/runtime_agent/agent.rb`,
`core/lib/ovallsp/cache/`, `core/lib/ovallsp/diagnostics/engine.rb`

Today the unknown-method check only fires on a *closed* receiver, and a
class is closed only when the workspace can see its whole ancestry. In a
Rails application that is a minority of classes: a controller inherits
from `ApplicationController`, whose parent is in a gem, so the check
stays silent there — correctly, but silently. The result is that the
check works where it is least needed and says nothing where most code is
written.

The running application knows all of it. Measured against a small Rails 8
app: 3027 named modules loaded, 2204 of them attributable to one of 63
gems, contributing 15868 methods defined directly on them. Names only,
that is roughly 365KB — small enough to persist, far too much to send on
every query.

**Direction:**

- the Agent walks loaded modules once, attributing each to a gem through
  `Object.const_source_location` and the `…/gems/<name>-<version>/` path,
  and reports, per class: its own methods, its ancestors, and whether it
  defines `method_missing`;
- Core persists that per gem-version, in the cache store that already
  exists for file summaries. `Gemfile.lock` already contributes to the
  cache key, so the invalidation shape is in place — but it should become
  per gem rather than whole-index, so a single bumped gem re-indexes one
  gem and not sixty-three;
- with that, "closed" stops meaning "declared in this workspace" and
  starts meaning "we know its full method set", which is the honest
  question. Most receivers in a Rails app become closed, and the check
  becomes useful where the code actually is.

It also subsumes several entries above: 024.R5's reopened-gem-class case
(the index knows `ActiveSupport::TestCase` is a gem class), and the
latent `unresolved-constant` flood (the index knows `Rails` exists).
024.R5 stays as the narrow, cheap version for 0.1.7 — one question per
constant, no persistence — and is a stepping stone to this rather than a
competing design.

**Risks to settle when building it, not after:**

- what is loaded depends on the environment and on eager loading, so the
  index describes *a* boot, not the gem in the abstract. It must be
  recorded as such and never treated as proof a method is absent unless
  the class was actually seen;
- classes that define methods at runtime (`define_method` in an included
  hook, `method_missing`) are already handled by the existing
  `method_missing` rule, which must apply to gem classes too;
- the walk costs real time on a large app and must not block the first
  query — the same background/degrade-to-static shape the Agent already
  uses.
